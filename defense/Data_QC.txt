SDSFIE-V at version 4.0 until all components have migrated data to it
the IGG SOP (standard operating procedure) is in place

DoDI 8130.01 requirements for Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) and data handling guidance are 'works in progress'

IGI&S systems of record are moving to COTS solutions in a secure cloud environment

As IGI&S matures - DATA QUALITY - becomes a big issue

IGI&S is becoming an authoritative data source. 

Fiscal Year 2017 CIP Data Call -
Annual data call synced with Real Property Inventory (end of fiscal year)

ANG was terrible in terms of data quality 2017
=== how to fix ===
= Implement SDSFIE-V 4.0
    - Improved definitions, attributes
    - data  can be cleansed during migration from 3.0/3.1 models
= Implement SDSFIE-M 2.0
    - Every piece of data needs metadata
    - Version 2.0 includes data quality metrics
= Leverage annual CIP requirement to drive fixes.

Metadata - the foundation of VAUTI
accessible, visible, understandable, trusted, interoperable

DoDI 8320.2

"information dominance"

LIBERTARIAN PATERNALISM
- both terms are currently unpopular, and seemingly contradictory
- neither concept should be controversial
- Libertarian - protect the individual's right to choose
- Paternalism - do what you can to improve the welfare of people

IGI&S Authoritative Data Source (ADS) 
Why Each Installation Needds One
The ADS must provide mechanisms to make data visible, accessible, understandable, trusted, and interoperable.
==========================
Fac Man, Emergency Planinng and Response, Range Management, Force Protection and Security, Env Management, Energy Management, Master Planning
==========================
The ADS is intended to be the "Geospatial Library" for each Installation.
    - Contents are curated
    - Contents are catalogued
    - The Librarian is the ADS Manager
    - Libraries contain English language materials - SDSFIE is the language for the IGI&S

DoDI 8130.01    -       This instruction establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides governance procedures for IGI&S

GEOINT          -       In the United States, Geospatial intelligence, GEOINT (GEOspatial INTelligence) is intelligence about the human activity 
                        on earth derived from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes, assesses, and 
                        visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. GEOINT, as defined in US Code, 
                        consists of imagery, imagery intelligence (IMINT) and geospatial information.

Questions -
JRSS - file:///home/johndoe/Downloads/trip/JRSS-Fact-Sheet-April-2017.pdf
JRSS is supposed to stop all implementation because it makes impletentation of IGI&S basically impossible.

Data handling guidance -
